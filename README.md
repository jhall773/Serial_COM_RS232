# Serial_COM_RS232
The application designed here was made for an Electrical engineer at Lockheed Martin to specify communication preferences between a laptop/PC and an external device over serial COM ports using the RS232 standard connector. This application was tested by writing messages from my laptop/PC to an Arduino R4 Minima's memory.

Note: I was unfamiliar with the topic of serial and COM port connections, and at first was not even aware of the coding applications of a "Serial, Non-network, non-socket based" application. So, I did some resrearch on what COM ports are and got quite a bit of help from Microsoft's Copiolot AI, which led me to an open source pyhton library called pyserial.
